## Graph Spectra

The spectral graph clustering algorithm is implemented with the paper “On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm” by Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss. 

### Run

We implemented this assignment in Matlab, so after opening the main.m file, one can edit the 3 variables to test the code :
    
    K  =  the number of clustering we want to test
    Sigma =  the sigma in Affinitiy Matrix A 
    Filename = the filename of testing data

After editing 3 variables, one can just run the script and  get a result figure.

### Result

The results are saved in the file `Report.pdf`.
